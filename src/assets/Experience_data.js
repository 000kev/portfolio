  'To describe myself at the beginning of my undergraduate journey, the best way to put it was to say that I was lost. I arrived in Cape Town, a supposedly ‘smart’ kid, far away from my support structure, with a fragile ego that was dangerously entangled with my intelligence. UCT was a series of waves, and I was used to swimming in still waters, but I only swim for leisure so let me use a more appropriate metaphor. I’ve been a gamer all my life, and there are two important lessons that games have taught me that I have earned only through the trials of time and effort. The first is that every game has an ending, and the second is that you can only ever reach an ending through effort. There is an African proverb that says ‘It takes a village’ and what I’ve learned in life that differs from games is that that proverb is true, especially when you’re trying to muster the effort for a height you’ve never reached before. UCT was the hardest game, I’ve played so far. I had to try different strategies, I had to learn what kind of a player I am, what my strengths and weaknesses were, how to turn my strengths into weaknesses, and ways to compensate for them when I couldn\’t.',
  'There is not a game in my life that I haven’t finished, and after conquering UCT, I know there is no game or challenge that I will not see through to completion. My time as a student challenged me in a way that differed significantly from games, however. In games, I always knew that I could win because I had infinite time to get better - to learn. I intuitively understood that time and effort was the key to success. The psychological impact of time restrictions and the unpredictability of the South African student experience was a challenge that affected me mentally and was the biggest hurdle I had to overcome - my final boss per se. But here’s another thing about me, I’ve never been one to shy away from the difficult games - and the tough conditions of my undergraduate experience just meant that I had to get tougher. I had everything I needed in me to win, I just needed to be tough enough to wield it. That’s what I did, and that’s why I speak with quiet confidence in this little essay or this little website. What I realised was that toughness isn’t just an external action, but an internal one too - in the little habits of time and effort that are nurtured with discipline that grow like mustard seeds over time, and here I am, still growing, with no intention of stopping.',
  'There is a saying that Everything is Connected - it may seem superficial, maybe even naive but I can see how every single win and every single loss have resulted in the winner that I am today. My work experiences, which at the time, seemed random at best or over-eagerness at worst, were pivotal in that they gave me something that I did not have before which was perspective. Similarly with my leadership experience, perspective is what differentiates second place from the runner-up. Second place is static whereas runner-up is dynamic; a place stays still but a runner does not, and suddenly I’m reminded of the days in High School on the Athletics track. The saying should go: \‘Everything is Connected… Just, sometimes, not in the way you expect.\’ I used to think I thought too scientifically for business, then that I was too business-minded for science, but now I know that the truth is some third thing that changes based on perspective. Perspective changes on what a thing needs, and that is how I believe everything is connected, and that is how I am both a scientist and businessman and so much more. I have learned to hold my wins and my losses; science and business; things that are a part by themselves but connected to more than just those individual things by themselves. I did a bit of Philosophy too, if it wasn’t already obvious.',
  'When I say that I am a Global Citizen, it’s not because I can speak 3 languages excluding English, it’s not about my upbringing or the places I’ve travelled, or the diverse people and cultures of the world that I’ve engaged with. I am a Global Citizen because, through time and effort, I have come to understand that problems are rarely if never singular, they are just a part of a bigger problem that we face on a global scale. That’s why technology changes the world the way it does: because it is a solution to a problem, and business is the vehicle that drives technology forward, for better and unfortunately for worse, and that is why I am a Global Citizen. My experiences, my leadership and skills, and my education have given me above all, the perspective to be able to see every problem as one that has a solution, for those willing to devote the time, effort, and the toughness to solve it. Where problems cannot be solved, the experience, skill, and education to look at the problem with a different perspective.',

'My graduation ceremony will be held at the end of March 2024. My hope for the future is to be able to see and experience more of the world. I am confident that my affinity for languages and sensitivity and understanding to different cultures will give me the tools to build lasting relationships inernationally and locally. I wish to work in differet parts of the world, mastering the languages that I know while building a truly international network of game-changers, entrepreneurs, industry giants and trailblazers. I am broadly interested in many fields of Computer Science, but am specifically interested in Mathematics and the intersection of the two fields Cryptography. Additionally, I am heavily interested in the power of change through Education and have entreprenueral ventures planned in this regard, especially for younger and vulnerable children who do not usually have access to high-quality education. I intend on furthuring my studies in post-graduate Mathematics and Statistics in the future, but would like to work in industry and am seeking entry-level positions as a Software Developer, Machine Learning Engineer, Blockchain Developer, or an International Business Information Technology Consultant for start-up or large firms.'
